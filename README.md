# Lowracer Project

This was a project run in the 2020-21 academic year to build a lowracer for ASME based on the work done for Zephyr (2018-19) and Blueshift (2019-20). However due to the COVID-19 pandemic running *(much)* longer than expected the lowracer's construction made no meaningful progress during the year due to lockdowns and was ultimately cancelled to focus on the aircraft project that was being started in 2021.

The boards were designed, ordered, and assembled. However no code was prepared since the project was cancelled shortly after the boards were assembled.

## Software Used

The board designs were originally done in KiCad 5, but have been ported forward to 7.0.10. **This was the team's first project to use KiCad over EAGLE!**
